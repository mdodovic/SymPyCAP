# SymPyCAP

The SymPyCAP is software for linear, time invariant circuit analysis.

## Installation

The project is written entirely in Python, so Python 3 is necessary.
If this requirement is met, you can clone this repository and install the package using:

```
$ git clone (DODATI LINK)
```

## Jupyter Notebooks

We recommend using SymPyCAP with Jupyter Notebooks.
For a number of examples use [test_examples/SymPyCAP_notebook_examples.ipynb](link!!!!):

```
$ cd test_examples
$ ipython -c "%run SymPyCAP_notebook_examples.ipynb"
```

**test_examples** also contains:\
     1)	*SymPyCAP_IDE_example.py* - example of symPyCAP usage in Python IDE (e.g. Spyder)\
     2)	*SymPyCAP.py* - copy of original class to make usage of SymPyCAP fully operational within this folder\
     3)	*SymPyCAP_notebook_examples.pdf* - read-only test examples from Jupyter Notebook file \
     4)	*SymPyCAP_notebook_examples.tex* - editable LaTeX test examples from Jupyter Notebook file \
     5)	*circuit_images* - contains images of electric circuit solved in *SymPyCAP_notebook_examples.ipynb*

## Video tutorials

Videos which demonstrate set up and usage of SymPyCAP solver are on YouYube:

[How to set up SymPyCAP envirnoment] (link)\
[Test example: Voltage divider] (link)

Language of all videos are Serbian, and **English caption** is provided to every video as the YouTube option.
