# SymPyCAP

The SymPyCAP is software for linear, time invariant circuit analysis. It is developed by following team of students and professors from [University of Belgrade – School of Electrical Engineering](https://www.etf.bg.ac.rs): 

* Katarina Stanković
* Matija Dodović
* Nikola Ilić
* Jelena Bakić.
* [Prof. dr Dejan V. Tošić](http://home.etf.rs/~tosic/)
* Prof. dr Milka M. Potrebić


*symPyCAP.py* - class that encapsulates symbolic circuit analysis (project kernel)

**documentation** - contains:\
				*Documentation.pdf* - read-only complete documentation of SymPyCAP project\
				*Documentation.md* - editable markdown documentation of SymPyCAP project 
					
**test_examples** - contains:\
				*SymPyCAP_IDE_example.py* - example of symPyCAP usage in python IDE (e.g. Spyder)\
				*SymPyCAP_notebook_examples.ipynb* - test examples solved step-by-step in jupyter notebook\
				*circuit_images* - contains images of electric circuit solved in SymPyCAP_notebook\
				*SymPyCAP.py* - copy of original class to make usage of SymPyCAP fully operational within this folder without any changes of code.

Videos which demonstrate set up and usage of SymPyCAP solver are on youtube:
