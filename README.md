# SymPyCAP

The SymPyCAP is software for linear, time invariant circuit analysis. It is developed by following team of students and professors from [University of Belgrade – School of Electrical Engineering](https://www.etf.bg.ac.rs): 

* Katarina Stanković
* Matija Dodović
* Nikola Ilić
* Jelena Bakić.
* [Prof. dr Dejan V. Tošić](http://home.etf.rs/~tosic/)
* Prof. dr Milka M. Potrebić

IDE_example_input.py - example of symPyCAP usage in python IDE (i.e. Spyder)

symPyCAP.py - class that encapsulates symbolic circuit analysis
