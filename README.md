# SymPyCAP

The SymPyCAP is software for linear, time invariant circuit analysis.

## Installation

The project is written entirely in Python, so Python 3 is necessary.
If this requirement is met, you can clone this repository and install the package using:

```
$ git clone (DODATI LINK)
```

## Jupyter Notebooks

We recommend using SymPyCAP with Jupyter Notebooks.
For a number of examples use (test_examples/SymPyCAP_notebook_examples.ipynb)[link!!!!]:

```
$ cd test_examples
$ ipython -c "%run SymPyCAP_notebook_examples.ipynb"
```

**test_examples** also contains:\
     1)		*SymPyCAP_IDE_example.py* - example of symPyCAP usage in Python IDE (e.g. Spyder)\
     2)		*SymPyCAP.py* - copy of original class to make usage of SymPyCAP fully operational within this folder\
     3)		*SymPyCAP_notebook_examples.pdf* - read-only test examples from Jupyter Notebook file \
     4)		*SymPyCAP_notebook_examples.tex* - editable LaTeX test examples from Jupyter Notebook file \
     5)		*circuit_images* - contains images of electric circuit solved in *SymPyCAP_notebook_examples.ipynb*
