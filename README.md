# SymPyCAP

The SymPyCAP is software for linear, time invariant circuit analysis.

## Installation

The project is written entirely in Python, so Python 3 is necessary.
If this requirement is met, you can clone this repository and install the package using:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mdodovic/SymPyCAP
```

## Jupyter Notebooks

For monitoring this work we recommend Anaconda, free open-source Python distribution. Within it, the environment we recommend for SymPyCAP is Jupyter Notebook.

For a number of examples use [test_examples/SymPyCAP_notebook_examples.ipynb](https://github.com/mdodovic/SymPyCAP/blob/main/test_examples/SymPyCAP_notebook_examples.ipynb):


**test_examples** also contains:
1) *SymPyCAP_IDE_example.py* - example of symPyCAP usage in Python IDE (e.g. Spyder)
2) *SymPyCAP.py* - copy of original class to make usage of SymPyCAP fully operational within this folder
3) *SymPyCAP_notebook_examples.pdf* - read-only test examples from Jupyter Notebook file
4) *SymPyCAP_notebook_examples.tex* - editable LaTeX test examples from Jupyter Notebook file
5) *circuit_images* - contains images of electric circuit solved in *SymPyCAP_notebook_examples.ipynb*
