# SymPyCAP

SymPyCAP is software for the symbolic analysis of linear time-invariant electric circuits.

This software is presented at the **2023 10th International Conference on Electrical, Electronic and Computing Engineering (IcETRAN)**, and published by **IEEE**. 

The publication can be found [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10192115).

Bakić, "SymPyCAP: Software for symbolic analysis of electric circuit," 2023 10th International Conference on Electrical, Electronic and Computing Engineering (IcETRAN), East Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, 2023, pp. 1-5, doi: 10.1109/IcETRAN59631.2023.10192115.


## Installation

The project is written entirely in Python, so Python 3 is necessary.
If this requirement is met, you can clone this repository and install the package using:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mdodovic/SymPyCAP
```

## Jupyter Notebooks

For monitoring this work we recommend [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), free open-source Python distribution. Within it, the environment we recommend for SymPyCAP is Jupyter Notebook.

For a number of examples use [test_examples/SymPyCAP_notebook_examples.ipynb](https://github.com/mdodovic/SymPyCAP/blob/main/test_examples/SymPyCAP_notebook_examples.ipynb):


**test_examples** also contains:
1) *SymPyCAP_IDE_example.py* - example of symPyCAP usage in Python IDE (e.g. Spyder)
2) *SymPyCAP.py* - copy of original class to make usage of SymPyCAP fully operational within this folder
3) *SymPyCAP_notebook_examples.pdf* - read-only test examples from Jupyter Notebook file
4) *SymPyCAP_notebook_examples.tex* - editable LaTeX test examples from Jupyter Notebook file
5) *circuit_images* - contains images of electric circuit solved in *SymPyCAP_notebook_examples.ipynb*
	

## Video tutorials

Videos which demonstrate set up and usage of SymPyCAP solver are on YouYube:
