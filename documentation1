//// About SymPyCAP ////

SymPyCAP is program for solving linear, time-invariant electric circuits. This program is Python-based 
(It's written entirely in Python) and uses SymPy, a Python library for symbolic mathematics.

///// Why SymPy?  /////

SymPy is completely free, open source and licensed under the BSD license. So, you can modify the 
source code end sell it if you want to. 

SymPy uses Python as its language. This means that if you
know Python, it is much easier to get started with SymPy (because you already knows the syntax). 
And if you don't know Python, it is really easy to learn. 

Third advantage of SymPy is that it is lightweight program. It has no dependencies other than Python,
so it can be used almost anywhere easily. 
And finally, it can be used as a library. You can just import it in your own Python application.

////// Algorithm //////

-Nodes:

* Refference node - one node, labeled by zero, 0 (default node). The node voltage of this node (reference node) is set to zero, 0.
* Other nodes - labeled by consecutive integers, starting from one, 1.

-The Kirchhoff’s current law equations

* SymPyCAP formulates the KCL equations for all nodes, except refference node (for other nodes).
* The currents are expressed in terms of node voltages.
* The refference direction for current is out of the node.

-Modified Nodal Analysis:

SymPyCAP uses MNA (Modified Nodal Analysis) to formulate equations.
MNA variables: node voltages and currents which cannot be expressed in terms of node voltages. 
* Node voltages are labeled by V1, V2, V3...
* V0 = 0 by default
* Currents are labeled by I"ID" ("ID" specifies a circuit element).

//////   Units   //////

All quantities are in the International System of Units (SI).

// Electric Circuit  //

The input of this program (the circuit to be analyzed) is specified as a list of circuit elements (list of lists):
[list_1, list_2, list_3, ... list_N]

A circuit element (list_I) is specified as a list:
* for one-port element: [type, label, a, b] 
                        [type, label, a, b, IC]
* for two-port element: [type, label, [a1,a2], [b1,b2], p]
                        [type, label, [a1,a2], b] (b = b1 when b2 is ground node)
                        

type - string that specifies type of element ("R", "L", "C", "Z", "Y", "I", "V", "OpAmp", "IdelalT", "InductiveT", "VCVS", "VCCS", "CCCS", "CCVS")
label - string that identifies circuit element ("R1", "L1", "C1", "Ug", "OpAmp1", "I1", "VCVS1", etc.)
a - positive terminal
b - negative terminal
IC- initial conditions at 0 - minus
a1 - positive terminal of the 1st port
a2 - negative terminal of the 1st port
b1 - positive terminal of the 2nd port
b2 - negative terminal of the 2nd port
p - parameter of parameters

/// Calling SymPyCAP  ///

--- For time-invariant analysis:
____________________________
system = Solution(elements)
solution = system.symPyCAP()
____________________________
-elements - arbitrary name for list of circuit elements (it can be any other word..)
-system - instance of class Solution (main class of the program)
-symPyCAP() - this method initializes V (to Vi), user defined symbols, creates MNA equations, for every element in circuit, solves linear system of equations by variables, checks validity of every element and returns the solution
-also, it can read replacement list for user symbols,  for example:
 - solution = system.symPyCAP(replacement = ["R1=R", "R2=R"])
 - solution = system.symPyCAP(r = ["R1=R", "R2=R"])
 
 --- For time-variant analysis: 
_______________________________
system = Solution(elements)
solution = system.symPyCAP("W")
_______________________________
-"W" - complex frequency.
It can be replaced with:
  -> " "  - solution = system.symPyCAP()
  this means that frequency is not specified - by default, it will be marked as "s" in the solution
  -> w = "W"  - solution = system.symPyCAP( w = "W")
  -> omega = "W"  solution = system.symPyCAP( omega = "W")
-in this version, also, method can read replacement list, for example:
- solution = system.symPyCAP( w= "W", replacement = ["R1=R", "R2=R"]) etc.

--- Outputs:
__________________
1) print(solution)  
__________________
- this function returns the solution in the following form: { variable1: solution(variable1), variable2: solution(variable2)... }

______________________________________
2) for sol in solution:
     print(sol,":",solution[str(sol)])
______________________________________
-solution in form: variable1: solution(variable1)
                   variable2: solution(variable2)
                   ...
                   
________________________                
3) print(solution['Vi']) 
________________________
- solution for a single node (Vi): solution(Vi)

__________________________________________
4) system.electric_circuit_specifications()
__________________________________________
-this function returns:  Circuit specifications: 
                         Number of nodes: N

                         Replacement rule:  {}
                         Equations:  []
                         Variables:  []
                            
___________________________                           
5) system.print_solutions()
___________________________
- returns exactly like 2): variable1: solution(variable1)
                           variable2: solution(variable2)
                           ...

____________________________________
6) system.print_specific_solutions()
____________________________________
- returns the solution in the same form as 5) and 2), but with applied replacement rules (R1=R, C2=C,...)
